# Plan

We need plots:

* comparitive study of different data images (in all / most following categories)

* 3d energy landscape plot?
    * 1 circle to be found, drop r, plot xy coordinates visited?

* behaviour of energy function
    * all values (show / visualize markov lenghts / temps)
    * means per temp
    * also variance
    * 'the real data'
    * try to find evidence of phase transitions / glassy system 'T_glass'

* effect of ensemble size
    * brick wall effect

* curse of dimensionality

* problems in area-based cost function
    * see how minimizes in terms of current difference cost fun
    * demonstrate doesn't always exactly conform to our visual idea of 'good fit'
    * small circles -> irrelevant?
